			<p class="content">
			 No guesses here! Bugatti takes home the trophy for the most expensive car in the world. Making its debut a year ago at the Geneva International Motor Show, the one-of-a-kind La Voiture Noire is priced at $18.68 million. The name of the car translates to The Black Car.  The new La Voiture Noire packs 1,500 horsepower and 1,180 pound-foot of torque that propels it from 0 to 60 mph in 2.5 seconds. It has a quad turbo W-16 engine with a top speed of 261 mph.

			A surprise entry, the exotic car boasts of a 7.3-litre naturally aspirated V12 engine, with a power of 789bhp. It also has a six-speed manual gearbox. In addition, it spots forged aluminum wheels—20-inch in the front and 21-inch in the rear. The rear wheel fairings are made from carbon fibre.

		<p class="sub3">Rolls Royce Sweptail:&nbsp;$13 million or Rs 92 crore</p>
			<p class="content">
			The much revered Rolls Royce makes its entry at third spot, thanks to the swanky Sweptail. The car is the result of inspiration from "a special patron’s admiration" of his favourite cars of the early 20th Century, as well as many classic and modern yachts, Rolls Royce notes on its website. Apparently, it took nearly five years for the car manufacturer to deliver the bespoke design to a repeat client.
